  "body": "On the 29th of June, Shopify made an important announcement: Shopify 2.0. What exactly does that mean for your store? How important are these new features? Should you hurry to upgrade to it?\n\n## What is Shopify 2.0?\n\nShopify 2.0 is a new update to Shopify service with enhanced features and faster performance. The Shopify platform is the one which powers eCommerce for over a million businesses, so it's imperative that this company continues to introduce innovative product and service opportunities.\n\nWhile Shopify is one of the most versatile eCommerce platforms, there was a requirement for greater customization choices for landing pages and product pages specifically. With Shopify 2.0, the need for customized product pages is gone.\n\n## What are the new features and advantages of Online Store 2.0?\n\nThe main benefit of Shopify's online store 2.0 is that the administrator can more flexibly edit, change, and maintain this package. We have ranked the most notable features and their advantages below.\n\n\\-ÔªøTABLA COMO IMAGEN-\n\n### **Sections available on all pages**\n\nHave you heard the phrase, Sections everywhere? This feature is the most significant and eagerly anticipated enhancement for Shopify platform users.\\\n\\\nWhat are these ‚Äú*sections‚Äù*¬†and how do they improve customer experience and boost sales?¬†\n\nSections are content blocks that you can put on your page to customize the look of your site. Sections everywhere indicate that you can now put these blocks on every page of your site.\n\nIÔªøn the past, these sections were limited page by page, which made editing too complex and difficult. Some page builder apps like Shogun try to fix this, but they all came with their own set of new problems.\n\nBÔªøut with Shopify 2.0, you no longer need to use page builders to customize the content of your site. You can now reuse the same sections in different parts of your site. That is because you get a whole new world of opportunities to personalize your site and build customized landing pages that will increase sales and improve your customer satisfaction.\n\nOpportunities open up for the store owners when using this tool to their benefit.\n\n### **Amazing upgrade to Shopify‚Äôs metafields**\n\n*We‚Äôve made a major update to metafields that makes it easier to manage your store‚Äôs metadata. From ingredient lists to customer details, you can now easily store and reference different types of metafields within Shopify. üè∑Ô∏è¬†[pic.twitter.com/nQejqeByrv](https://t.co/nQejqeByrv)*\n\n*‚Äî Shopify (@Shopify)¬†[June 29, 2021](https://twitter.com/Shopify/status/1409922963030351882?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)*\n\n2.0 made a massive upgrade to Shopify's metafields. You do not need to add an external app or laboriously hardcode the display of modifications to your template, you can now just edit your metafields through the new admin. The new content types are color, product, variant page, measurements, file, information, time, true, number, and evaluation.\n\n**NÔªøow you can:**\n\n\\-ÔªøAdd extra content\n\n\\-ÔªøAdd ingredient lists\n\n\\-Do product specifications on a per-product basis\n\n### **Upgraded theme editor**\n\nAll merchants who have the OS2.0 store currently have the benefit of a refreshed Shopify theme editor that's quicker to use and easier to customize than the previous one.\n\n## Should you transition into Shopify 2.0?\n\nIt entirely depends on your needs at the moment. Dango advises clients to first of all research their current store. While the benefits are evident, it depends on your particular case, and we can help to decide if it's worth it or not.\n\n## Is Dawn Shopify Theme a good option?\n\nDawn is 35% faster compared to Debut, has all the amazing functions of Shopify 2.0, and runs on all devices and browsers. Therefore, Dawn can become aÔªø very good alternative for a Shopify store.\n\nAt the end of the day, IÔªøt's a very good starting point, but its limitations and lack of visual flare are usually not enough for the needs of most companies. \n\nWÔªøe can help you find the perfect theme that fits your needs or help you build a custom one.",
